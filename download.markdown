To write parallel programs for your Arduino in occam, you need three things:

1. **A text editor**. Notepad++ on Windows, TextWrangler or Textmate on the Mac, or Emacs or vi on Mac/Linux all are good examples.

1. **Plumb**. This tool handles compiling your code and uploading it to the Arduino.

1. **A 'net connection**. For the moment, we put our Arduino compiler in the cloud. You'll need an Internet connection to compile your programs.
