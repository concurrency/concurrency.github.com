## The Community is You

Things people have done out there.

### Creating Libraries

### Contributing Docs

### Giving Back, Making Contributions

FIXME: Break this apart into above sections. Update.

If you'd like to help improve anything we've produced &mdash; our software, our hardware, our book, or our website &mdash; please join the [developers mailing list][lists] and talk to us there.

If you're familiar with Subversion, we do make [repository space available for members of the community][repos]. This means your code is backed up, others can see what you're working on (and help!), and your efforts benefit many, even if you're just getting started. (It also makes it easier for others to help you out.) Note, though: your code must be released under a GPL- or LGPL-compatible license if we're going to host it.
