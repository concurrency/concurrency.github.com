* **Getting started with the Arduino**  
  If you want to get started programming your Arduino, we recommend checking out our book, [Plumbing for the Arduino](/book)
* **Continuing with occam programming**  
  If you have more general questions about occam-&pi; programming, check out the [additional resources]() that are available online.
* **I HAVE QUESTIONS!**
  If you have questions, please join our [users mailing list][lists] and follow our [blog][blog]. We [tweet][twitter] from time-to-time as well.) The mailing lists really are a great place to ask questions when you're getting started and trying to figure things out.

### Giving Back, Making Contributions

If you'd like to help improve anything we've produced &mdash; our software, our hardware, our book, or our website &mdash; please join the [developers mailing list][lists] and talk to us there.

If you're familiar with Subversion, we do make [repository space available for members of the community][repos]. This means your code is backed up, others can see what you're working on (and help!), and your efforts benefit many, even if you're just getting started. (It also makes it easier for others to help you out.) Note, though: your code must be released under a GPL- or LGPL-compatible license if we're going to host it.
