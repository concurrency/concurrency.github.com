## Plumb for the Arduino

First, grab Plumb, which will let you run write occam programs and run them on your Arduino. 

* [Plumb for Mac][mac-plumb]
* [Plumb for Windows][windows-plumb]

[windows-plumb]: http://jadud.com/downloads/Plumb-20130619.zip

Drag-and-drop the app (Mac) or folder (Windows) somewhere, pin it to your dock/start menu. Plug in your Arduino, launch the app, and you're almost ready to go.

## Quickstart

1. Open Plumb.
1. From the "Examples" menu, under "Testing," select the program that blinks pin 13 on and off.
1. Save this somewhere as a .occ file.
1. Send it to your Arduino!

The first upload will take a while, because we're doing a lot of work; each time you send your code after that, it will go much faster.

There's no issues in flipping back-and-forth between Plumb and the Arduino environment; we're just uploading (somewhat special) sketches.

## Explore!

Once you open plumb, you can use the "Help" menu to pop open some examples as well as browse documentation that will get you started.

We also have a [number of docs and books that you might find useful][docs]. Please feel encouraged to [join our mailing list and ask questions][userlist], or ping us [@concurrencycc][ccc] for help. (Extended queries are best asked on-list, but we're listening and keen to help!)

### A Text Editor

Before you can do anything, you're going to need a text editor. Word or Open Office won't cut it; this is code, not prose.

We have a version of GEdit you can download for Mac and Windows. These versions include syntax highlighting for occam, which is very handy.

## Getting Started 

Using Plumb is easy-peasy. We have a 30 second video that shows you everything you need to know.
