First, grab Plumb, which will let you run write occam programs and run them on your Arduino. 

* [Plumb for Mac (ver. {{page.version}})][mac-plumb]
* [Plumb for Windows (ver. {{page.version}})][windows-plumb]

[mac-plumb]: http://jadud.com/downloads/plumb/Plumb-{{page.version}}.dmg
[windows-plumb]: http://jadud.com/downloads/plumb/Plumb-{{page.version}}.zip

Drag-and-drop the app (Mac) or folder (Windows) somewhere, pin it to your dock/start menu. Plug in your Arduino, launch the app, and you're almost ready to go. Linux users, double-click the "Plumb" app in the "bin" directory after you expand it.

## Tutorials

We're developing a series of video and text tutorials to help you explore parallel programming with your Arduino.

## Explore!

Once you open plumb, you can use the "Help" menu to pop open some examples as well as browse documentation that will get you started.

We also have a [number of docs and books that you might find useful][docs]. Please feel encouraged to [join our mailing list and ask questions][userlist], or ping us [@concurrencycc][ccc] for help. (Extended queries are best asked on-list, but we're listening and keen to help!)

## The Source

Plumb is open source software. Check us out on [Github](http://github.com/concurrencycc).

### A Text Editor

Before you can do anything, you're going to need a text editor. Word or Open Office won't cut it; this is code, not prose.

We have a version of GEdit you can download for Mac and Windows. These versions include syntax highlighting for occam, which is very handy.

* [GEdit for Windows][windows-gedit]

[windows-gedit]: http://jadud.com/downloads/gedit-win.zip

## Getting Started 

Using Plumb is easy-peasy. We have a 30 second video that shows you everything you need to know.

### Configuring GEdit

GEdit has some really nice features when it comes to writing code. This 30 second video walks you through choosing options that will make your programming experience all that much better!
