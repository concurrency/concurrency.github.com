## plumb for the Arduino

First, grab plumb, which will let you run occam programs on your Arduino. 

* [Mac][mac]
* [Windows][windows]

[mac]: plumb.dmg
[windows]: plumb.zip

Drag-and-drop the app (Mac) or folder (Windows) somewhere, pin it to your dock/start menu. Plug in your Arduino, launch the app, and you're almost ready to go.

### A Text Editor

Before you can do anything, you're going to need a text editor. Word or Open Office won't cut it; this is code, not prose.

* **Windows**: We recommend Notepad++ or GEdit.
* **Mac**: TextWrangler, Textmate, GEdit, or many other editors will work just fine.

On all platforms, Emacs or vi are options if you're feeling hardcore.

## Explore!

Once you open plumb, you can use the "Help" menu to pop open some examples as well as browse documentation that will get you started.

We also have a [number of docs and books that you might find useful][docs]. Please feel encouraged to join our mailing list and ask questions, or ping us [@concurrencycc][ccc] for help. (Extended queries are best asked on-list, but we're listening and keen to help!)
