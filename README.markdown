# Concurrency.cc Website

This is the source repository for the Concurrency.cc website.
The website is generated directly from here using [Github Pages][ghp], which uses [Jekyll][jekyll].
To contribute to the site, you'll need to use Git and [Markdown][markdown] - all of the principles are the same as detailed in the Github Pages and Jekyll documentation.
If you're doing more than editing an existing page or adding a new blog post, you might find you need some HTML.
If you're in doubt about some changes, or are uncertain about anything [get in touch][devlist] on the developers mailing list and we'll help out.
If you've got something finished, submit a [pull request][ghpullreq].

## Building/Testing

The site's template use absolute URLs, which makes previewing from the static HTML output in the `_site` directory generated by Jekyll difficult.
Handily, this can be avoided by using Jekyll in server mode to preview the site, in which it provides a built in webserver (defaulting to port 4000) with the output served up.
This is a great way to test changes before committing - you can combine it with Jekyll's auto-reloading of changed files by running the following command in the root of the site sources.

	jekyll --server --auto

If the site doesn't seem to be rebuilding with the above command properly, there might be an error in the markdown - try running Jekyll without any arguments to see if there's any parse error reporting.

## Known Problems

The default YouTube and Vimeo embed codes cause problems converting Markdown into HTML (due to Maruku's overly strict parsing). As of June 2012 (these) can be fixed by:

* Ensuring `allowFullScreen` and similar attributes all have values set (i.e. allowFullScreen becomes `allowFullScreen="true"` or similar)
* For Vimeo, ensure there is HTML between the `<iframe>` tags, as otherwise the output will be truncated. It's easiest to move the credit line (Video Name by Author on Vimeo) into the iFrame tag, although a blank `<p>` tag will also suffice.
