##### Describe your organization.

Concurrency.cc is an umbrella for a number of projects that deal with parallel
and concurrent programming. The individual projects span a parallel programming
language (occam-pi), its compilers, tools, and runtimes. Concurrency.cc is
all about promoting and making occam-pi available to as wide an audience as
possible. To do this concurrency.cc provides a range of tutorial and educational
material, currently built around the embedded Arduino platform. The current
focus is to make occam-pi a viable alternative for the Arduino platform and to
produce some nice visible demonstrations of our work.

There is scope for doing projects in a wide range of areas, from compilers, to
interpreters, to embedded programming and working with little computers. The
following universities are currently involved in concurrency.cc projects:
Allegheny College, the University of Copenhagen, and the University of Kent.

##### Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2010? What do you hope to gain by participating?

Concurrency.cc is a new initiative to presenting our work in concurrent and
parallel programming. We are currently especially interested in promoting this
work on the Arduino platform and getting non-traditional programmers involved in
concurrent programming. Our main aim in applying to GSoC is to widen the
community that is engaged in the project. Getting some bright and motivated
students who engage and produce some visible success for the project will be
valuable in being able to interest others in the future.

##### Did your organization participate in past GSoCs? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation.
No we did not participage in past GSoCs

##### If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?
No we have not applied to GSoC in the past.

##### What license(s) does your project use?
GNU GPL 2.0, LGPL

##### What is the URL for your ideas page?
[Ideas page](/gsoc/2010/ideas)

##### What is the main development mailing list for your organization?
<developers@concurrency.cc>

##### What is the main IRC channel for your organization?
   #cpa on irc.darkmyst.org

##### Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use?
No

##### Who will be your backup organization administrator?
AdminMatthew Jadud - <matt@transterpreter.org>
(**Administrator:** Christian Jacobsen - <christian@transterpreter.org>)

##### What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible.
Mentors:

  * Christian Jacobsen
  * Jon Simpson
  * Matt Jadud

Christian Jacobsen: is an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen and
has been involved in the project since its inception. Christian has been
involved in several projects to engage students in 'cool stuff' while working
his PhD and is keen to use GSoC as an opportunity to do this again.

Matt Jadud: is an assistant professor at Allegheny College. He is used to
involving students in the projects he is working on and is always keen to share
his own enthusiasm with others. Matt has been working on the project since its
inception and is therefore familiar with most aspects of the project. Matt is
especially involved with Plumbing and the Arduino at the moment.

Jon Simpson: is a PhD candidate at the University of Kent. He was recruited
while he was an undergraduate student and therefore has an insight into how one
gets to grips with the project. Jon has worked on the RCX port of the
Transterpreter and is currently working on a graphical programming interface for
occam.

##### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

Ideally we would ensure that we create an environment in which students do not
feel they have to disappear. We will encourage planning, frequent communication and
suggest that students provide us with regular status reports. 

If students to disappear we will try to contact them and make sure that they are
not having a bad experience with the project.

##### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

We do not envision having mentors disappear for other than personal reasons.
There are a number of people working on the project who are not designated
mentors and we will ensure to also involve these in the GSoC. Thus, should a
mentor disappear there will be a natural way for others to step in to take the
role until the disappearing mentor is able to reappear.

##### What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?

We would encourage students to join our mailing lists and would also be keen for
them to publicise their experience in other ways, thus keeping them actively
communicating with both the established community and the outside world.

##### What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?

We hope that the student will be able to produce a tangible result during the
GSoC experience. We will publicise this for the benefit of both our project and
the students future development, and hope that buy having experienced a
successful outcome that they will see that there are opportunities for further
development within the project which will benefit both the student and the
project as a whole.
