[Plumbing for the Arduino](/book/) was written for the digital artist looking to creative engaging, interactive art. That said, it serves as an excellent introduction to parallel programming on low-cost, open-source embedded systems like the Arduino. 

### Spring 2010
*PftA* was used in [CMPSC220: Programming Languages](http://www.rockalypse.org/courses/cmpsc220sp10/) at Allegheny College during the Spring 2010 semester.
