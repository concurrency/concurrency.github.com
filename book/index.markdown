*Plumbing for the Arduino* is a gentle, Creative Commons licensed introduction to programming the Arduino using the programming language occam-&pi;. The most recent version is [freely available for download as a PDF](/pdf/plumbing-for-the-arduino.pdf).

<p style="background-color: #ffcccc;">
	Jan 24, 2011: The book has seen a partial update. Text/code inconsistencies have been updated, but we have not finished updating all of the diagrams. We will update those as quickly as possible. A new chapter regarding firmware upload was added.

 Continue to drop any issues to book-bugs at concurrency dot cc, but know that we're workin' hard.
