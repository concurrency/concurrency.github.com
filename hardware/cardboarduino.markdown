Inspired by the <a href="http://lab.guilhermemartins.net/2009/05/06/paperduino-prints/">PAPERduino</a> by Guilherme Martins, the Cardboarduino was developed by Matt Jadud, a member of the faculty at <a href="http://allegheny.edu/">Allegheny College</a> in the <a href="http://cs.allegheny.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>. It was originally designed to introduce students in <a href="http://act.ivism.org/">FS102: Technology and Activism</a> and <a href="http://act.ivism.org/">FS102: Art and Activism</a> to the fundamentals of soldering and working with physical computation. To date, over 40 people have built Cardboarduinos.

The Cardboarduino is physically larger than the PAPERduino, and includes space for a 9V battery clip. 

### The Design
The Cardboarduino is intended to be printed (actual size), cut out, and glued to the front and back of a piece of 5" x 6" piece of posterboard. The builder pokes holes through the posterboard everywhere there is a dot on the top side of the design. It also labels the locations of all of the components, including color bands for the resistors.

The bottom shows all of the pins that need to be soldered together with wire.
