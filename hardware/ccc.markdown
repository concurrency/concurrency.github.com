Developed by Omer Kilic (<a href="http://omer.kilic.name/">www</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/omerk">twitter</a>), a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.eda.kent.ac.uk/">School of Engineering and Digital Arts</a> at the <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a>, the concurrency.cc board gives us a surface-mount Freeduino variant with a step-up voltage converter.

What does this mean in plain English? We have an Arduino-compatible board that can be cheaply ordered in bulk for use with student and project groups. Most importantly, **the concurrency.cc board runs on a single AA battery**.

Once we have our first batch of boards built and tested, we'll provide all of the designs here under an open license. Watch this space!

### Second Revision
The second rev board made some small fixes, and is our first board that we would consider producing in quantity. A few more changes based on some student feedback are going in before we place any large orders, however.

We're running a small batch of these for build-and-test at Kent, and we have six boards at Allegheny that need to be built and tested as well. The black-and-gold boards are *really* pretty.

### First Revision
Omer's first board had some small problems with via alignment.

We were very excited&mdash;the new hardware is an important part of our ongoing work with the Arduino platform.

### First Revision, Debugged
With a bit of tweaking, the first revision runs like a charm; revised boards arrive soon. Here's a video of the board running our parallel blinkenlights code.
