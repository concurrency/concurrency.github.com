For a long time, there weren't many "new" people working with our tools. Therefore, our lists lived behind an https:// address with a self-signed certificate. This caused problems for many people. If nothing else, it threw big scary warnings claiming **Bad Things** were about to happen.

I've moved things around. Our lists are now completely open.
               
 * Our list for **users** of process-oriented programming (things like Plumbing, or JCSP, etc.) is <users@concurrency.cc> ([list homepage](http://unhosting.org/mailman/listinfo/users)).

 * Our list for **developers** working on these kinds of tools (contributing to Plumbing, etc.) is <developers@concurrency.cc> ([list homepage](http://unhosting.org/mailman/listinfo/developers)).

Please join in the fun. I'll try and get another post up over break about things that are going on with the team. (Also, we'll know whether we're a GSoC participant!)
