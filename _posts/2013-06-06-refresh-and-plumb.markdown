title: "Website Refresh, Plumb"
---

First, the website picked up a big refresh today. That's a win. It will take time to make sure everything is ticking over nicely, but I'm looking forward to the process; we were still learning Jekyll with the last rev, and it's a bit more straight-forward now.

More importantly, we have some new tools, and those, too, will be easier to improve and manage over the coming weeks and months. 

### Plumb

Plumb makes it easy to get occam-pi code running on your Arduino on your <a href="{{site.plumb_mac}}">Mac</a> or <a href="{{site.plumb_win}}">Windows</a>.

#### Basics

You must plug your Arduino in before starting Plumb. Choose the code you want to send to your Arduino, and then hit "Run."

#### Loading Examples

If you want to see some instructional/educational example code, use the "Examples" menu.

#### Edit and Run the Examples

The example code can be edited and run directly from within Plumb. Keep in mind, this is not a programming environment; if you want to save your work, you'll need to copy-paste and do your programming somewhere else.
