title: Google Summer of Code

Yesterday we submitted an application for the 2010 [Google Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). You can find our
[application](/gsoc/2010/application.html) and [ideas](/gsoc/2010/ideas.html) right on
this site. We won't know if we have been accepted as an institution  until the
18th of March, but if you are interested in doing a Google Summer of Code
project with us it is probably worth contacting us about it now. Even if we
don't get accepted as a mentoring institution, we would of course still be more
than happy for anyone to come and join the project and do cool stuff!

If you want to get in touch with us about Google Summer of Code and projects, [join the developers list](/docs/mailinglists.html) and drop us a note.
