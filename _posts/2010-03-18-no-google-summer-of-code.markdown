title: No Google Summer of Code
---

No Google Summer of Code interns for concurrency.cc this year, but that did not
come as a great surprise. This years application was in large motivated by us
having talked about submitting to GSoC for a few years, but never actually
doing it. We have never really had enough time to do the application and we
have not seen ourselves as an organisation with the right profile to get
accepted. However, without submitting an application there is no chance of
getting accepted and this year we decided to *just do it*. We did, did not get
accepted, and now have some time to reflect on what would make us more
attractive as a mentoring organisation for GSoC in the future. Building a
bigger and more active community is probably a good start in this respect.

So, while we're not going to get any Google Summer of Code interns this year,
that should not stop anyone from [downloading](/download.html) the software, joining
the [mailing lists](/docs/mailinglists.html), and doing awesome stuff.

Congrats to [all the organisations that did get
accepted](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010).
