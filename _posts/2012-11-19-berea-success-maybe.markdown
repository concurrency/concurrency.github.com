##Updates
So after our meeting with Dr. Jadud, we found that we needed to incorporate a rate of climb to control our pitch.  Today we started on trying to implement this, and we feel that we have succeeded!  Our plane is able to obtain our desired alititude (+-25 ft).  This is a major breakthrough for us because we haven't been able to obtain such success yet.  We were able to test decreasing and increasing altitude and all worked as desired.  Although it does go down a bit fast, it doesn't fall out of control, and everything went well.

##Whats next?

Our next goal is to fine tune our controls a bit more, and then try to implement GPS.  Although we only have 2 weeks of class left we are setting high goals to motivate ourselves, I mean who else would go to class till midnight on their own?

##Did You know?
Thanksgiving fact!
Why is it always on the last Thursday of November?

Abraham Lincoln issued a 'Thanksgiving Proclamation' on third October 1863 and officially set aside the last Thursday of November as the national day for Thanksgiving.
